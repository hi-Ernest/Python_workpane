Big data is a field that treats of ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases(rows)offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity(more attributes or columns)may lead to a higher false discovery rate.
Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.
Other concepts later attributed with big data are veracity(i.e., how much noise is in the data)and value.
